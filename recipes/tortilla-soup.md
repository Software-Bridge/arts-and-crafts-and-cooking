### Notes

**Preparing Chicken**

For this recipe I prefer to prepare chicken ahead of time, either to barbeque it an hour or so early, or else I use leftover chicken (say from a roast) for it.  I do prefer the chicken 'holds it's own' in the soup, so I prefer to do a barbeque with some extra flavoring on it.  

For example coated in olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder and italian seasons.  Otherwise if I have some leftover chicken I might saute it in a skillet with the same ingredients for a minite or so to give it some extra flavor and texture. 

**Fried Tortilas**

Generally I fry around eight medium corn tortillas in a small saucepan with canola oil, one at a time, resting on a plate with a paper towel to absorb some of the oil. Usually I put about four into the soup base, but will add more if the base seems too thin.  Break them up before putting into the base. The remaining fried tortillas are added when the soup is served.

I have used store brought tortillas as a substutite (as frying is always a mess) and have not been satisfied, particularly witht the extra salt on most chips.  If I could find some good fried but unsalted chips I might use them. 

**Blending the Soup Base**

A key step is using the immersion blender to help thicken the broth.  However a typical such blender has a metal edge and will mess up a ceramic or stick-proof pan.  I like to cook in ceramic so when I'm ready to blend, I pour the whole soup into a large old metal pan, blend in that, then pour that back into the ceramic.  

**Corn on the Cob vs. Kernels**

If you include corn on the cob you want to add that in a bit earlier than some of the vegetables.  I like how much flavor the is absorbed in the cob that you get when you eat it, however others I make this soup for don't like the mess of eating it that way so I often just make the soup with kernels.  If using kernels, I prefer frozen corn, which can be added right at the end with the chicken. 

**Noodles**

I like to add noodles, but every time I've included them in the cooking process I either end up with them way overcooked in the soup, or else they absorb the rest of the soup when we save it for later.  

So what I do now is pour about a cup of soup into a bowl, and let that completely cool before I make the noodles, which I add to the cold soup in the bowl (and further drain off most of the liquid).  This way the noodles don't stick together and can be saved for later.  When done this way, I serve the noodles with the other extras after the soup is done. 

I do prefer smaller noodles but really any sort works.  Probably Mexican products like fideo and other mini-noodles are more traditional, but I've used orzo, regular small elbow noodles, etc.
